	        <font size="+1">I was born and grew up in a small village in the Western part of Ukraine surrounded by beautiful nature and loved people. However, since early childhood, I wanted to travel the world and knew that my ambitions and desires will not be satisfied if I stay in the village. That is why when I was 15 years old I have started thinking about where I should go to study and what will be my future career. I have always been working hard at school because I have always been told by my parents that if you want to achieve something in this life you have to work for it. Besides that, I have been always doing different kinds of art so I can definitely say that I am an art person and love everything related to it and its aesthetics. At 17 I left my hometown and went to study Business at LCC International University, liberal arts university in Lithuania. I have been actively participating during the last two years in the LCC community being a Resident Assistant working in kids summer camps. One of the best experiences in my life so far was my exchange semester in France about which you can read further.</font>
