	 <h1 style="text-align:center;">My Exchange Experience in France</h1>
	 
	  <p style="text-align:center;"> As a student, I had a chance to participate in Erasmus+ Program and go to study for one semester in another country. I have chosen to go to ESDES Lyon Business School in France.<br> As soon as I came to France, there were a few things I fall in love with: food and architecture. I can bet that there is no anywhere in the world such tasty croissants as in France as well as the <br> architecture of this country I would distinguish from any other as it is super special, I would say unique. I have been spending a lot of time walking around the streets of Lyon city,<br> sitting on the bank of the Rhone river with my friends watching sunsets. Going to study to the local cafes where you smell the Medieval ages French and enjoy watching the French people <br> who live without the rush. The best thing that I gained from this experience is people. I was able to not only explore the French culture and lifestyle but also meet people from about 50 different countries <br> who came for the same reason as I did. Being alone in the new country we all have been uniting together and my Erasmus community is what made this experience memorable.</p>

	  <p style="text-align:center;"> The best part of my experience has been traveling. During my exchange semester, I have been to many places in France and neighboring countries. I have been to Paris, Marseille, Annecy,<br> a small village with vineyards called Odenas as well as I had a chance to go to Geneva, Switzerland, and Milan Italy. Even though we all have a general picture of what the city in France looks like, I must <br> admit that even though the architecture style is similar or the same, they all are super different. Each city has its own charm and vibe. There is no need to speak about Paris, Milan, and Geneve <br> as we all know a lot about them. I would rather mention two other cities which usually are not popular among tourists but I recommend everyone to visit them at least because of the nature there. <br>  One of those places where I went to that made me surprised in a good way is Marseille. It is one of the most criminal cities in France and honestly, I was a little bit scared to go there after reading different <br> statistics of crime in the region and stories of tourists being robbed and not only. We went there and spent the whole day in the national park 40 minutes away from the city center <br>  at the seaside among mountains, rocks with the most transparent seawater that I have ever seen. After being at one of the best locations that I have ever been to return to the city center where <br> it was a completely different atmosphere, not peaceful at all and sometimes not even secure. However, I would say that this city is a good illustration of how the contrast France is in all the possible ways.<br> I do not regret going there and think for those who want to feel full of what France is like, Marseille is the place to go.<br> The other place in Annecy, a small city close to Switzerland, that no one usually knows about just left me speechless after I saw the combination of French architecture with streets <br> on the water as in Italy and its crystal lake with background and reflection of Alps. That view took my breath and made me fall in love with Annecy forever.</p>
